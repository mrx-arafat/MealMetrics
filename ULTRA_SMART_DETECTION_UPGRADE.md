```

### AI Intelligence Features:
- **🍛 Rice Detection**: Granular texture and color pattern recognition
- **🍛 Curry Detection**: Glossy sauce consistency and rich color identification
- **🥕 Vegetable Recognition**: Color-based detection (green, orange, red)
- **🥩 Protein Identification**: Texture and color analysis
- **🍞 Garnish Detection**: Light-colored items (onions, lime, herbs)

## 📊 Specific Improvements for Your Image Type

### **Rice & Curry Dishes** (Your exact use case):
- ✅ **Mixed Rice**: Detects grain patterns with colorful vegetables
- ✅ **Fried Rice**: Identifies golden/brown color with grain texture
- ✅ **Curry Sauce**: Recognizes glossy, rich orange/brown colors
- ✅ **Vegetable Mix**: Spots small colorful pieces throughout
- ✅ **Protein Chunks**: Identifies darker pieces mixed in rice
- ✅ **Garnish**: Detects light-colored toppings

### **Blurry Image Strategy**:
1. **Focus on dominant colors** - Main color zones identification
2. **Identify textures** - Grainy (rice), smooth (curry), chunky (vegetables)
3. **Look for patterns** - Repeated small shapes = grains
4. **Use plate context** - Size and layout for portion estimation
5. **Detect cooking methods** - Glossy = oil/sauce, matte = dry cooking

## 🎉 Results You Can Expect

### **Before Upgrade**:
- ❌ "Couldn't detect what food it is"
- ❌ Failed on blurry images
- ❌ Poor accuracy in low light
- ❌ Single AI model dependency

### **After ULTRA-SMART Upgrade**:
- ✅ **Detects rice, curry, and vegetables** even in very blurry photos
- ✅ **Handles dark, low-contrast images** with aggressive enhancement
- ✅ **Multiple AI models** ensure analysis always succeeds
- ✅ **Specialized food recognition** for South Asian cuisine
- ✅ **Accurate calorie estimates** from enhanced images
- ✅ **Detailed food breakdowns** with cooking methods

## 🔥 Key Features for Your Specific Needs

### **Rice Dish Intelligence**:
- Recognizes **basmati rice**, **fried rice**, **biryani**, **pulao**
- Detects **mixed vegetables** in rice dishes
- Identifies **curry sauces** and **gravies**
- Spots **protein additions** (chicken, mutton, etc.)

### **Challenging Photo Handling**:
- **Motion blur** from shaky hands
- **Low lighting** conditions
- **Poor focus** from phone cameras
- **Steam/heat distortion** from hot food
- **Reflective surfaces** and **glossy foods**

## 📱 How to Test

1. **Upload your original blurry rice photo** to the bot
2. **Watch the enhanced analysis** with detailed breakdown
3. **See accurate calorie estimates** and food identification
4. **Get proper nutritional information** for each component
