## Files Modified

### 1. `utils/helpers.py`
**Function: `enhance_image_for_analysis()`**

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added input validation for None images
- ✅ Added image size validation (too small/large detection)
- ✅ Improved error logging with stack traces (`exc_info=True`)
- ✅ Added multiple fallback levels:

```
ERROR - Error processing photo for user 12345: [error]
```

### After:
```
ERROR - Error processing photo for user 12345: [error]
ERROR - Error type: ValueError, Error details: [detailed message]
INFO - Opening image file: /tmp/tmpXYZ.jpg
INFO - Image opened successfully - Size: (1920, 1080), Mode: RGB, Format: JPEG
INFO - Starting AI analysis of food image
DEBUG - Sending request to model (attempt 1/2)
DEBUG - Received response with status code: 200
INFO - AI analysis completed - Success: True, Error: None
```

---

## Fallback Mechanisms

### Image Enhancement:
```
Level 1: Full enhancement (numpy + PIL advanced)
    ↓ (if fails)
Level 2: Basic enhancement (PIL only)
    ↓ (if fails)
Level 3: Simple resize
    ↓ (if fails)
Level 4: Original image
```

### Error Message Delivery:
```
Level 1: Formatted Markdown message
    ↓ (if fails)
Level 2: Plain text message
    ↓ (if fails)
Level 3: Logged error only
```

### AI Analysis:
```
